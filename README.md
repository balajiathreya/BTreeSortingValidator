# BTreeSortingValidator
A B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree, where each node has n keys and n+1 children and n

can be different for each node. The keys are sorted the same as in a binary search tree. For each key k in 

the tree, all children to the left must have keys less than k, and all children to the right must have keys 

greater than k.

Write a method that validates whether a B-tree is correctly sorted. You do NOT need to validate whether 

the tree is balanced. Use the following model for a node in the B-tree.
